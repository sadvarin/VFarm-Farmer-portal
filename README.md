With the digital revolution reaching all parts of India, there is need for modernization of
agriculture sector. According to a report by BIF, IoT (Internet of Things) and AI-based
applications could create over 2.8 million jobs in rural India over 8 to 10 years with an
annual value of IN â‚¹60,000 crore (About US $8.9 billion).
Out of the 2.8 million jobs, at least 2.1 million will be created for the agriculture sector.
The predicted boom in the agriculture sector can only be harnessed by the overall
development of farmers and equipping them with the latest technologies and knowledge.
there are solutions that exist which can bring significant change in the overall
development of agriculture sector and improving the income of farmers but with all of
them being distinct and discrete and present on different platforms, we have made an
online platform where we attempt to bring those solutions to one place and have used
machine learning to create solutions like crop recommendation which would give a clear
idea to the farmers to cultivate most profitable crop according to soil conditions and
rainfall pattern and plant disease detection system will also help farmers to detect
whether their crop is infected with disease or not. The website contains other features
which can help them to find live crop pricing, various call centres and state helpline
which would make this website a supportive tool and a symbol for modernization and
growth.
